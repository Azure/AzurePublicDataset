# Azure LLM inference trace 2024

## Introduction
This is a sample of the traces from multiple LLM inference services in Azure, collected on May 10<sup>th</sup>-19<sup>th</sup> 2024. This dataset is the data described and analyzed in the HPCA 2025 paper 'DynamoLLM: Designing LLM Inference Clusters for Performance and Energy Efficiency'.

The dataset comprises this description and a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Azure/AzurePublicDataset/blob/master/analysis/AzureLLMInferenceDataset2024.ipynb) with the plots in the HPCA paper.

### Schema
|Field|Description |
|--|--|
| TIMESTAMP | Invocation time |
| ContextTokens | Number of context tokens |
| GeneratedTokens | Number of generated  tokens |

### Prompt content
Due to customer privacy requirements (e.g., GDPR), we do not have visibility into the content of the prompts. We instead use the production traces to guide the input and output sizes, where we send the input prompt with the required number of tokens, 
and force the model to generate the corresponding number of output tokens for each request. Note that the text of the inputs prompts does not impact the performance metrics that we benchmark, since they depend only on the input and output sizes.

### Validation
This data is the sample data used in the HPCA paper mentioned above.
