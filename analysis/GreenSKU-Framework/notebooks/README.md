The notebook uses the carbon model to calculate the carbon savings of a GreenSKU configuration compared to a baseline configuration. The notebook also calculates the carbon savings of a GreenSKU configuration compared to a baseline configuration with a fixed carbon intensity. The notebook reproduces the figures in the paper and provides a detailed explanation of the calculations.
