# Data sources

This directory contains the data sources used as inputs for the GreenSKU Carbon Model. The data sources are organized as follows:

- `carbon_data/`: This directory contains the open-sourced data sources used in the carbon model. The data sources include the carbon intensity of the electricity grid, the embodied emissions of server components, and the power consumption of server components. The data sources are provided in yaml format.

- `AFR_data/`: This directory contains the data sources used to calculate the Annual Failure Rate (AFR) of server components by the maintenance model. The data sources include the AFR of server components and the failure rate of server components. The data sources are provided in yaml format.

- `other_data/`: This directory contains other data sources that we use to calculate carbon saving such as cluster data, fan power data, and data center carbon intensity data.
